# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
   Louise's Play was almost funded in a short amount of time, and she was curious what factors contributed to that. This anaylsis examines a wide range of successful, failed, cancelled, and live kickstarters and found launch date and goal to be key factors in determining success.  
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to look at kickstarters and determine what factors lead to their success.
## Analysis and Challenges


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Our analysis found that the summer was the best time to launch a kickstarter related to theater or plays as it has the most successes. We also found that summer is the time most kickstarters launched, so our conculsion is that the launch date is not the only contributing factor to a successful kickstarter play.   

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Our analysis look at another factor to determine a successful kickstarter, the goal. Our anaylsis shows that kickstarters with lower goals are more successful and more likely to be funded. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The main challenge encountered is sample size. Since every value is not equally represented (e.g. Kickstarters with a goal above $50,000 only had 16 in total and others had sample sizes in the 1000s) While our results are accurate based on the data we have, more data is required to truly determine what factors determine success. 
## Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Most kickstaters are launched in the summmer. The summer has the highest amount of successful kickstarters.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Kickstarters with a lower goal have a higher chance of being funded/successful. 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The limitation of this dataset is that we only examined theater related kickstarters, so if someone asked about what factors contribute to video game kickstarter successes, the conclusions drawn from this analysis would not be entirely accurate. 
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
A column chart to compare values across a few categories.
