# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
   Louise's Play was almost funded in a short amount of time, and she was curious what factors contributed to that. This anaylsis examines a wide range of successful, failed, cancelled, and live kickstarters and found launch date and goal to be key factors in determining success.  
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to look at kickstarters and determine what factors lead to their success.
## Analysis and Challenges


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
